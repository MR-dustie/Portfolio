                        I am full-time year 1 student studying Game Design and Animation in Hong Kong Baptist University. 
                        Since 2016, I have dedicated serious time in improving my craft. This website is an accumulation of my sizable work.

                    <h3> More about my background </h3>

                    <p>
                        Throughout my childhood, the consistent highlight of my day was turning on the TV to watch silly cartoons on channels such as Cartoon Network. My elder sister and I would draw for hours on sketchbooks to create worlds to share with one another as well. 

                        The positives of art had encouraged me to engage in art communities, take comic classes, and choose visual art in secondary school.
